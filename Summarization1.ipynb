Il souligne que, malgré de nombreuses initiatives (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Ayushman Bharat, Jeevan Jyoti, etc.), certains citoyens restent exclus ou doivent parcourir de longues démarches. À travers ce voyage, il écoute les témoignages – un accidenté guéri grâce à la carte Ayushman, une veuve aidée de 2\\u202flakh\\u202f₹ après le décès de son mari, une famille bénéficiant du gaz domestique – pour s’assurer que les aides sont distribuées sans corruption. Il constate que ces réussites renforcent la motivation des fonctionnaires, qui trouvent satisfaction lorsque leurs actions se traduisent par des améliorations concrètes dans la vie des gens. Le discours insiste sur le fait que la véritable réduction de la pauvreté se mesure quand les ménages ne perçoivent plus la différence entre richesse et précarité, grâce à des services essentiels comme le logement, la santé et le gaz. Le Yatra, selon lui, constitue un examen de terrain indispensable pour aligner les promesses gouvernementales avec la réalité du terrain.'"

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states.

Concluding, he called for an inclusive, transparent, and corruption‑free India where health, education, energy, and opportunity are universally accessible, urging every citizen to join the mission of making India a prosperous, secure, and happy nation before 2020.  \\n\\n*Jai\\u202fHind.*'"

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005.

The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

The address repeatedly returns to this question as the *“guiding factor”* for all actions. |\n",
      "| **2** | **Empower villages** | Village councils need financial autonomy, decision‑making power, and robust physical connectivity. | In Nagaland (Oct 2002) the President visited Khuza ma village, saw an empowered tribal council and thriving orchards, but noted the need for quality roads to link the village to markets. |\n",
      "| **3** | **Mobilise rural core competence for competitiveness (PURA model)** | Leveraging rural strengths through **PURA – Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas**—physical, electronic and knowledge connectivity—makes villages economically competitive. | • **Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women** (Vallam, Tanjore) created a PURA complex covering 65 villages (≈300 000 people). <br>• **Physical connectivity:** upgraded roads, bridges, and transport services. <br>• **Electronic connectivity:** broadband, tele‑centres, and e‑governance kiosks. <br>• **Knowledge connectivity:** schools (primary‑to‑post‑graduate), vocational training centres, health‑care units, and a hub for **≈1 000 self‑help groups**. <br>• **Outcomes:** conversion of 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land; dozens of new entrepreneurs; cultivation of Jatropha, medicinal herbs, biomass‑based power, food‑processing units, and village‑level marketing centres. |\n",

      "| **4** | **Strengthen the “seed‑to‑food” chain** | Build an end‑to‑end agricultural backbone—high‑quality seeds, efficient water use, reduced land & manpower, value‑addition, and market access—to double production and raise farmer incomes. | • **6000 farmers** who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan’s Mughal, Herbal, Spiritual, Musical, Bio‑diesel and Nutrition Gardens interacted with horticultural specialists, underscoring the demand for **integrated, science‑based farming**. <br>• In a national symposium *“Agriculture Cannot Wait”* Kalam highlighted practical farmer suggestions: **double output on less land and water**, protect fertile soil, and launch a **“Second Green Revolution”**. <br>• He projected **≥ 4 % annual growth in agricultural GDP** through **partnerships among farmers, agricultural scientists, and industry** for value addition. |\n",
      "| **5** | **Partner for problem‑solving** | Multi‑stakeholder collaboration (government, private sector, NGOs, academia, diaspora, and international agencies) is essential to tackle complex challenges. | The **JETRO‑PURA partnership** exemplifies how foreign expertise, local institutions, and community groups co‑create market‑ready products. The farmer‑scientist‑industry alliance envisioned at the symposium reinforces this collaborative ethos. |\n",

      "| **1** | **Youth‑driven development** | The aspirations of the 540 million young Indians must steer every policy, profession and innovation. | The 2006 question from a Haryana school‑girl – *“Why can’t India be developed before 2020?”* – encapsulated a nationwide yearning that Kalam repeatedly cites as the *guiding factor* for all actions. |\n",
      "| **2** | **Empower villages** | Village councils need financial autonomy, decision‑making power, and robust physical connectivity. | In Nagaland (Oct 2002) Kalam visited Khuza ma village, saw an empowered tribal council and thriving orchards, but noted the need for quality roads to link the village to markets. |\n",
      "| **3** | **Mobilise rural core competence for competitiveness (PURA model)** | Leverage rural strengths through **PURA – Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas** (physical, electronic, knowledge connectivity) to make villages economically competitive. | In **Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women** (Vallam, Tanjore) a PURA complex now serves 65 villages (≈300 000 people) with: <br>• **Physical** – upgraded roads, bridges, transport. <br>• **Electronic** – broadband, tele‑centres, e‑governance kiosks. <br>• **Knowledge** – schools, vocational centres, health units, 1 000 self‑help groups. <br>• **Outcomes** – 200 acres of waste land reclaimed, new entrepreneurs, Jatropha & medicinal‑herb farms, biomass power, food‑processing units, village‑level marketing centres. <br>• **Tech partnership** – 8‑month collaboration with **JETRO** produced 55 internationally‑competitive lifestyle prototypes (shown in Delhi & Tokyo). <br>• **Scalability** – ≈ 7 000 PURA units needed nationwide. |\n",
      "| **4** | **Strengthen the “seed‑to‑food” chain** | Build an end‑to‑end agricultural backbone—high‑quality seeds, efficient water use, reduced land & labour, value‑addition, market access—to double production and raise farmer incomes. | • **6 000 farmers** who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan’s themed gardens interacted with horticultural specialists, underscoring demand for **integrated, science‑based farming**. <br>• At the *“Agriculture Cannot Wait”* symposium, Kalam highlighted farmer suggestions: **double output on less land and water**, protect fertile soil, launch a **“Second Green Revolution.”** <br>• Projected **≥ 4 % annual growth in agricultural GDP** through farmer‑scientist‑industry partnerships for value addition. |\n",
      "| **5** | **Partner for problem‑solving** | Multi‑stakeholder collaboration (government, private sector, NGOs, academia, diaspora, and international agencies) is essential to tackle complex challenges. | • The **JETRO‑PURA partnership** exemplifies foreign expertise, local institutions, and community groups co‑creating market‑ready products. <br>• The **Urusa village** experience (post‑2005 earthquake) shows how the **Air Force, Army, state government, acting Chief Justice of J&K, and local citizens** jointly provided relief, medical aid and school reconstruction, turning disaster into a platform for collective action. <br>• **Pan‑African e‑Network** – a $100 million satellite‑fiber‑wireless system linking 53 African nations with Indian partners (7 Indian & 5 African universities, 12 Indian & 5 African super‑specialty hospitals, 53 tele‑medicine & 53 tele‑education centres). The pilot in **Ethiopia** already delivers MBA courses to 34 Ethiopian students and tele‑medicine services from CARE Hospital, illustrating how **cross‑continental partnership** can accelerate connectivity, health and education outcomes. |\n",
      "| **6** | **Build resilience against disasters** | Strengthen preparedness, early‑warning systems, and rapid‑response mechanisms to minimise loss of life and livelihood. | Kalam’s visit to **Urusa village** after the 2005 quake highlighted the need for **robust disaster‑management infrastructure** and the power of community ownership (“they have become the master of the problem”). <br>• In **Chuckchucha (Car‑Nicobar) village**, after the 2004 tsunami, tribal islanders **adopted orphaned victims as their own** and sang Kalam’s poem *“Sea Waves”*, demonstrating community‑wide courage and solidarity. |\n",
      "| **7** | **Expand connectivity for societal transformation** | Extend roads, digital infrastructure, and knowledge networks to bridge the rural‑urban divide and empower citizens. | The **three‑fold PURA connectivity** (physical, electronic, knowledge) is presented as the template for nationwide rollout, ensuring every village can access markets, information and services. <br>• Kalam’s address to the **Pan‑African Parliament (Johannesburg, 16 Sept 2004)** emphasized that **connectivity is the catalyst for societal change**, a message he repeats for India’s villages. <br>• The **Pan‑African e‑Network** provides a concrete, international illustration of how satellite, fiber‑optic and wireless links can create a continent‑wide platform for **tele‑education, tele‑medicine, research collaboration and skill‑development**—a model that can be adapted to India’s own PURA rollout. |\n",

      "| **3** | **Mobilise rural core competence for competitiveness (PURA model)** | Leverage rural strengths through **PURA – Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas** (physical, electronic, knowledge connectivity) to make villages economically competitive. | In **Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women** (Vallam, Tanjore) a PURA complex now serves 65 villages (≈300 000 people) with: <br>• **Physical** – upgraded roads, bridges, transport. <br>• **Electronic** – broadband, tele‑centres, e‑governance kiosks. <br>• **Knowledge** – schools, vocational centres, health units, 1 000 self‑help groups. <br>• **Outcomes** – 200 acres of waste land reclaimed, new entrepreneurs, Jatropha & medicinal‑herb farms, biomass power, food‑processing units, village‑level marketing centres. <br>• **Tech partnership** – 8‑month collaboration with **JETRO** produced 55 internationally‑competitive lifestyle prototypes (shown in Delhi & Tokyo). <br>• **Scalability** – ≈ 7 000 PURA units needed nationwide. |\n",
      "| **4** | **Strengthen the “seed‑to‑food” chain** | Build an end‑to‑end agricultural backbone—high‑quality seeds, efficient water use, reduced land & labour, value‑addition, market access—to double production and raise farmer incomes. | • **6 000 farmers** who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan’s themed gardens interacted with horticultural specialists, underscoring demand for **integrated, science‑based farming**. <br>• At the *“Agriculture Cannot Wait”* symposium, Kalam highlighted farmer suggestions: **double output on less land and water**, protect fertile soil, launch a **“Second Green Revolution.”** <br>• Projected **≥ 4 % annual growth in agricultural GDP** through farmer‑scientist‑industry partnerships for value addition. |\n",
      "| **5** | **Partner for problem‑solving** | Multi‑stakeholder collaboration (government, private sector, NGOs, academia, diaspora, and international agencies) is essential to tackle complex challenges. | • The **JETRO‑PURA partnership** exemplifies foreign expertise, local institutions, and community groups co‑creating market‑ready products. <br>• The **Urusa village** experience (post‑2005 earthquake) shows how the **Air Force, Army, state government, acting Chief Justice of J&K, and local citizens** jointly provided relief, medical aid and school reconstruction, turning disaster into a platform for collective action. <br>• **Pan‑African e‑Network** – a $100 million satellite‑fiber‑wireless system linking 53 African nations with Indian partners (7 Indian & 5 African universities, 12 Indian & 5 African super‑specialty hospitals, 53 tele‑medicine & 53 tele‑education centres).
